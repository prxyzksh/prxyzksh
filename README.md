#### Introduction

- I am a Bash/Python developer. I work on freelance projects for scripting and automation of tasks in Linux file systems, networking, data & regex.
- Below is the scope of projects I undertake and how to contact me in case you have a shell scripting or data processing task you wish to assign.

#### Scope of projects/tasks

1. Bash/shell script development. Automation related to Linux OS, configurations and security hardening, networks, file handling, regular expressions & patterns, and bulk data processing.
> - Scripting, regex (sed, awk, ...), network administration, file systems & processes, security/encryption, package management, access control & user management, etc.
 
2. Python: systems-level projects and/or data processing. Note that I do not take on web development tasks (Flask, Django, etc.).
> - Libraries: os, sys, subprocess, re, numpy, pandas, matplotlib.

#### Procedure for requesting a task

1. Send a description of the task or project and the required deliverable(s). Please be precise so I can make an assessment on whether the task/project falls within scope. Send your description to `xrzfyvqk_k1jw at pm dot me`.

2. Depending on the description you send, I may ask a few questions relating to the project (e.g. if something important is missing or some deliverable needs clarification, basically to avoid the <a class="external reference" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem">XY problem</a>).

3. If the above goes well, a fixed price (P) and an estimated time (T) required for project completion will be communicated to you. These depend on how large and complex the project is. You can send a counter-proposal at this point.

4. If an agreement is reached, 3 milestones will also be decided timewise: (T/3, 2T/3, T), and project work will begin. Communication back and forth throughout the project will be by e-mail and via Telegram app.

5. A first deliverable will be submitted at T/3 from project start, and thereafter P/3 should be sent in payment. The same is repeated for the second deliverable at 2T/3. The third and final P/3 payment will occur at T, but right before the final deliverable (marking project completion).

> 0 ------------> T/3 ------------> 2T/3 ------------> T ----> E

- Project work starts at time 0.
- At T/3  : deliverable-1 is submitted first, and a payment of P/3 is made. The project continues.
- At 2T/3 : deliverable-2 is submitted first, and a payment of P/3 is made. The project continues.
- At T    : A payment of P/3 is made first, and deliverable-3 is submitted (completing the project). Modifications can be addressed during [T - E] if requested (a period of 1 week).

By default, upon project completion, I may place a generic copy of the project's code in my GitHub repository. The copy will not include any detail identifying or relating to the client or company (i.e. it will only include the source code stripped of private data or info). If you have reservations regarding the placement of the project's code on GitHub, please mention it early on in step 1.
