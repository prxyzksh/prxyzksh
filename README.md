#### Introduction

- I am a Bash/Python developer. I work on freelance projects relating to scripting and automation of tasks in linux, file systems, networking, data and regex.
- Below is the scope of projects I undertake and how I can be reached in case you have a shell scripting or data handling task you wish to assign.

#### Scope of projects/tasks

1. Bash/shell script development of any scope (small tasks to large projects). Automation scripts relating to Linux OS, network administration, file handling, regular expressions & patterns, and bulk data processing.
> - Scripting, regex (sed, awk, ...), network commands, filesystems & processes, security/encryption, package management, access control & user management, etc.
 
2. Python: system-level and/or machine learning related projects only. Note that I do not take on web development tasks or front-end GUI design.
> - ML libraries (data, statistics, and visualization): numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, tensorflow, imblearn, scipy, statsmodels.
> - Systems-related libraries: os, sys, subprocess, re.

If your project is of a wider scale, you may send a description so I can make an assessment on whether any subtasks can be undertaken.

#### Procedure for requesting a task

1. Send a description of the task or project and what you would like to have as deliverable(s). Be as precise as you can so that I can make an assessment on whether the task/project falls within the above scope. It is okay if you are not sure about technical aspects or what can be done, but you need to know precisely what it is you want. Send your description to `xrzfyvqk_k1jw at pm dot me`.

2. You will get a reply within 48 hours. Depending on the description you send, I may ask a few questions relating to the project (e.g. if something important is missing or some deliverable needs clarification, basically to avoid the <a class="external reference" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem">XY problem</a>).

3. If the task/project is accepted, a fixed price (P) and an estimated time (T) required for project completion will be communicated to you. These depend on how large and complex the project is. P and T are negotiable to some extent (i.e. you can send a counter-proposal at this point).

4. If an agreement is reached, 3 milestones will also be agreed upon time-wise, (T/3, 2T/3, T), and project work will begin. Communication back and forth throughout the project will be by e-mail and via Telegram app.

5. A first deliverable will be submitted at T/3 from project start, and thereafter P/3 should be sent in payment. The same is repeated for the second deliverable at 2T/3. The third and final (P/3) payment will occur at T, but right _before_ the final deliverable (marking project completion).

> 0 ------------> T/3 ------------> 2T/3 ------------> T ----> E

- Project work starts at time 0.
- At T/3  : deliverable-1 is submitted first, and a payment of P/3 is made. The project continues.
- At 2T/3 : deliverable-2 is submitted first, and a payment of P/3 is made. The project continues.
- At T    : A payment of P/3 is made first, and deliverable-3 is submitted (completing the project). Modifications can be addressed during [T - E] if requested (not extending beyond 1 week).

By default, upon project completion, I may place a copy of the code written for the project on GitHub (as part of a work portfolio). No details relating to the client will be posted (only the source code in Bash or Python, stripped of any data or private info). If you have reservations regarding the placement of the project's code on GitHub, please mention it early on in step 1.
